# Changelog

## Unreleased

- Deploy helpers in `ops_deploy.helpers`: `system_user`, `systemd_unit`,
  `service_rollout` (daemon-reload and restart only on change; optional
  unconditional restart), `uv_sync` and `django_manage` (run as the service
  user via `runuser`, gated with `when_changed`), `traefik_route` with
  `TraefikRoute`/`BasicAuth` (controller-side bcrypt in `htpasswd -B` format,
  reusing a deployed hash that still matches), and the read-only checks
  `wait_port` and `http_check`.
- Test harness: `OpResult.read_only` and `FakeRun.mutating_changed_ops`, so a
  converged second run can be asserted while ignoring read-only checks.
- `toyweb` service: a toy uv/Django app that uses every helper, with
  deploy-level scenarios.
- Parity tests against the nyxmon and fastdeploy Traefik role templates.
- New dependency `bcrypt`; new dev dependencies `pyyaml`, `types-pyyaml`.

## 0.1.0 (unreleased)

- Project skeleton: uv, ruff, mypy (strict), pytest, mkdocs, GitHub Actions CI.
  pyinfra pinned to `3.10.*`, Python 3.12+.
- `BaseServiceConfig` with `CHANGEME` rejection (input, defaults and
  validated values), sanitized `ConfigValidationError`, `ServiceName` and `UnixUser`
  field types, and `required_secret_keys`.
- `SecretRef`, `SecretValues` (redacted, unpicklable) and the `SecretStore`
  protocol.
- `ops_deploy.testing`: `run_deploy_fake` with recording of facts, shell
  commands, uploads and `FunctionCommand` callbacks; `RecordingRsyncRunner`.
- Injectable controller-side rsync runner (`ops_deploy.core.rsync`).
- `toy` service deploy with first-run, no-op and change-run tests.
- `ops_deploy.ops.sync_tree`: rsync a controller directory to the host,
  replacing `ansible.posix.synchronize`. Plan-time itemized dry run (cached, so
  it runs once per deploy), owner set with `--chown` and never preserved,
  mandatory excludes for VCS/tool state and deploy state markers. The toy
  service uses it.
- `ops_deploy.ops.secret_file` and `SecretContent`: install a secret sent over
  stdin with a host-side Python installer that never follows symlinks and
  works through descriptors: a private 0700 staging directory next to the
  destination (checked on its descriptor), a 0600 `O_EXCL` file inside it,
  `fchown`/`fchmod`/`fsync`, and a rename as the commit point (directory
  `fsync` and staging cleanup after it are best effort). Interrupted or failed
  writes leave the destination untouched and remove the staging directory;
  leftovers from a killed run are removed by the next run. Forces
  `_get_pty=False`. Hosts need `python3` 3.8+.
- Harness: `FakeRun.stdin` records command stdin (excluded from `all_text()`),
  and `OpResult.args` records pyinfra's operation argument strings (included
  in `all_text()`).
